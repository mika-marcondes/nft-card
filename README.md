## My process 🔎

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As I worked on the challenge I've learned a lot about flexbox, although I didn't use, it led me to do some research about media query. I was able to improve things I've wanted to change from the first challenge — like how the font would break at some points.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I've learned a lot just by reading their content while applying them on the go.

## Acknowledgments 📢

As always, special thanks to my girlfriend who I woke in the middle of the night to ask questions. And my cats.
